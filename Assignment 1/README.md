#Feature Points Detection and Correspondences 

##Running command 

```python Template_Code.py training```  to get training result

In the running stage, it will generate four images in order: the keypoints in the left image, raw matching in the part2, horizontal matching in the part2 and final matching without ouliers in the part3.

In order to run the script properly, you should put the training and test repository at the same level with Template_Code.py.
